## Summary:
Each semester Indiana University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering sponsors research experience program for undergraduate majors, only a handful of students who apply for this opportunity are selected per semester. I was selected on my exemplary application to work one on one with a faculty mentor on Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning of the Bayesian Network Models. This opportunity gave be me valuable hands-on research experience with some of the leading experts in the field.
