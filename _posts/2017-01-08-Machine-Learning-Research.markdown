## Summary:
Each semester Indiana University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering sponsors research experience program for undergraduate majors, only a handful of students who apply for this opportunity are selected per semester. I was selected on my exemplary application to work one on one with a faculty mentor on Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning of the Bayesian Network Models. This opportunity gave be me valuable hands-on research experience with some of the leading experts in the field.

## Absract

Through out the history of Artificial intelligence Natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) has been at the forefront. Dating back to the 1950’s NLP 
algorithms have been refined and improved to focus more on statistical
and probabilistic data sets, instead of the prior linguistic approach. In
this research we compared and contrasted two algorithms: Naïve and
Viterbi, both working with Bayesian networks. Each algorithm learns
from a data set with part-of-speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) tagging
Ex. “Cheerful ADJ way NOUN to PRT spend VERB an DET evening NOUN”
after learning from the dataset the computer with be able to accurately
predict part of speech in single words and full sentences.

## Background

![Markdowm Image][2]

By using a Markov chain the computer is able to gather
enough information from the dataset to predict the
part-of-speech remarkable well. In the graph above it shows how
a system changes from one state to another over time. For exam-
ple: If state A was a NOUN what would the probability that state
B would be a VERB or vice versa. In this model the system in
state A is used to help the system transition to state B in order to
predict the next part-of-speech in the sentence . Using this statis-
tical and probabilistic approach the computer is able to mathe-
matically equate the probability of the part-of-speech in sen-
tence structures.
