As undergraduate students of the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering programs, we are privileged to be supported by the faculty and the school.  The flexibility of our degrees within Informatics and Computer Science is highly valuable. The curriculum pushes students to harness not only a great understanding of technology’s effect on society and us as individuals, but how we can implement these ideas across different industries. This is the perfect embodiment of product management.

<br>

The idea for Product Management Club was first developed after a couple of students came together to problem-solve how to increase Indiana University’s representation in industry within the PM field. The idea quickly was transformed into reality, with the initial vision to educate students and professors about the role of a Product Manager with regular presentations on key Product Management terms and ideas. Examples of such topics are as follows: Product vs Project Management, Product lifecycle, Agile mindset, Market research & analysis, and Customer focused development.

<br>

Product Management is one of the fastest growing knowledgeable professions while also being one of the most challenging. The process of conceptualizing, developing, and shipping software products is one of the most arduous and rewarding professions you can choose.

<br>

Various Product Managers in the industry serve as guest lecturers in order to share their first-hand experiences with students as well as provide information how they established their role. These speakers provide a great opportunity for students to explore questions from industry professionals.



Below is our first presentation to Indiana University students & faculty:
